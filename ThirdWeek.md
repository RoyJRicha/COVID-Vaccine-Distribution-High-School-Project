# Third Week
Came up with a project idea to start on  
The project is a webpage consisting of a quiz for students to do with many different subjects and 10 quizzez per subject starting easy from quiz 1 going to extremely difficult up to quiz 10  
Attempted to make the first page of the webpage but ran through many problems such as how to to build the form with the subjects in the dropdown  
Decided to take a step back and learn/reinforce topics in Angular so I have a better understanding and so I learn how to code in Angular  
Started with reading about the angular.json file in any Angular project and how it includes all the default directives and files that go into any angular project  
Then read about how to read and store data locally but I need to learn more about that considering I didn't have time to this past week because of hours of work in Angular videos  
Finally spent hours apon hours learning angular through a set of 59 videos, I have currently gone through 32 videos while spending almost 16 hours in 3 days  
The topics I learned/reinforced in these videos include the following  
Components  
Interpolation

Class Binding  
Style Binding  
Event Binding  
Template Reference Variables  
Two Way Binding

Will finish the videos relating to forms during this next week
