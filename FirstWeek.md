# First Week
Created an account on Github and made first repository and added code to that repository.  
Learned how to navigate Visual Studio.  
Learned how to use basic git and windows commands.  
These include git commit, git checkout, git push origin, git merge, and many more.  
For windows commands these include del, cd, dir, and many more.  
Then learned how to create new files under original repository as well as how to create new branches and merge branches.  
Learned how to resolve conflict when mergin different branches with differents changes on the Main.java file. In other words trying to make changes to the same file at the same time.
